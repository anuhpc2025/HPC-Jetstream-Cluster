prterun was unable to find the specified executable file, and therefore did
not launch the job.  This error was first reported for process rank
0; it may have occurred for other processes as well.
NOTE: A common cause for this error is misspelling a prterun command
   line parameter option (remember that prterun interprets the first
   unrecognized command line token as the executable).
